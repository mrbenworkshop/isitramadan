## **ISITRAMADAN? | MRBENWORKSHOP**  

I created this website as an Islamic alternative to **"IsItChristmas?"**, which informs people whether Christmas has arrived. As a Muslim, I wanted to build something similar to help and remind our Muslim brothers and sisters about the blessed month of **Ramadan**.  

### **Purpose of the Website**  
- The site **welcomes users by name** and remembers them on return visits.  
- It **checks the current Islamic month** and displays a clear **"YES"** or **"NO"** based on whether it is Ramadan.  
- If it is Ramadan, it provides **two to three randomly selected reminders** to encourage good deeds.  
- The footer displays the **current Islamic (Hijri) year** for easy reference.  

### **Additional Features**  
- Before entering, users are asked their name through a **pop-up form**, which is stored for future visits.  
- There is an optional question: **"Do you know MRBEN?"**  
  - If answered **"Yes"**, the user must correctly enter MRBEN's real name.  
  - If correct, a **Dua (prayer)** is displayed for them.  
  - If incorrect, they receive a polite message informing them that they don't know MRBEN.  

### **Why This Website?**  
As Muslims, **Ramadan** is one of the most significant months of the year, a time of fasting, worship, and reflection. This website serves as a simple but effective reminder of the **importance of Ramadan**, helping Muslims stay aware of its arrival and motivating them with helpful reminders.  

### **A Final Prayer**  
May Allah (SWA) accept our efforts, guide us on the straight path, and bless all those who visit this website and those who do not, granting us all goodness in this life and the next. **Ameen.**
